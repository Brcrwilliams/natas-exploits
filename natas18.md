The application sets a session identifier between 1 and 640.  It then checks the session data associated with this identifier for the admin => 1 key / value pair. Presumably, the admin account already has a session, so we can brute force the session identifiers in order to find the admin's. I simply used BurpSuite's intruder to do this.

Then, after a matter of time, we get a response which has a different length than the others.
